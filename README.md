The following is a simple example showing how to utilise PyCayenneLPP in your
own application:

```Python
from cayennelpp import LppFrame


# create empty frame
frame = LppFrame()
# add some sensor data
frame.add_temperature(0, -1.2)
frame.add_humidity(6, 34.5)
# get byte buffer
buffer = frame.bytes()
```
